# eChess

eChess is a [chess engine](https://github.com/playeChess/PCE) and a [place to play](http://playechess.com).

We are creating [our own database system](https://github.com/playeChess/ECDB), a [StockFish API](https://github.com/playeChess/stockfishAPI), and a web implementation for a [website](https://github.com/playeChess/website) to play tournaments against your friends or Stockfish.

You can even teach or discuss in classrooms.
